# Module Project: Composing Stateful Logic - Dark Mode

* Built a custom hook that let's you save data to localStorage
* Built a second custom hook that sets the `dark-mode` class on the body element
* Composed the two new hooks together to be able to set and persist user's dark mode preference in the app
